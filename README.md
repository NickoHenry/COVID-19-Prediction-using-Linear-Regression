COVID-19 Prediction using linear regression from scratch in C
This coding is made to predict the probability of how many people will be infected with COVID-19 using linear regression from scratch in C language. The result of this is that we can see the possibility of people infected with COVID-19 using data that previously existed, by training the old data, we can predict future possibilities.
